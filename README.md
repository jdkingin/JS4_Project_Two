## Project 2

Create a new website for a competitive activity that you know nothing or very little about. It can be anythingthat requires competition: curling, figure skating, skeet shooting, lumberjack games, dock dogs, etc. It can bea local, national, or a world competition.
* Use Git and GitHub with the methods covered to complete this project.
The site should contain at least the following Markdown pages:
* Home
* How the competition works (basic rules and purpose)
* Past winners (last competition placing or previous few years champions)
* Next Competition - Date, location, other details (Make this up if not available)
* This must contain at least:
  * four Markdown pages as aboveone Sass file
  * one JavaScript file to create a lightbox effect on the images
  * at least one image files per pageAt least two Nunjucks templates, one providing a unique home pagehighlight the current page in the navigation
* You can structure the files in your app and prod folder however you like. (You don't have to usethose names.) However, all source files must be in the app folder. (i.e. You can delete the prodfolder and recreate it by running Gulp.)
* Create a Gulp file to process the files as you see fit. Include a "watch" on your files so you can seechanges as you work.
* Present the final static site to the class and explain a bit about the competition that you chose.
