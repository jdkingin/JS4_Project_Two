# CSSA Canadian Shooting Sports Association

The shooting sports, for those involved, there are no limits! The recreational shooter may spend an evening a week, while others seek Olympic Gold. Whether youth, adult, or senior, shooting is a lifetime sport. Male or female, shooting emphasizes "equal opportunity" skills. For able-bodied and disabled alike, shooting sports are accessible. Shooting is a year-round activity; outdoors in the summer and indoors in the winter. Target shooting has a safety record unsurpassed by other sports. Clubs are located in most parts of the country, often surprisingly close to home.

In this area of our site the aim here is to provide a description of the many shooting sports that the members of our organization participate in. If you are a "recognized expert" in your discipline (that is you can write something about it) and are a member of the organization, then please send your gems of wisdom to us. Help us build these areas.

We look forward to hearing from you.
